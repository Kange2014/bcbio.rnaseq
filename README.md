# bcbio.rnaseq

## Overview
There are a bajillion different ways to call differential events from RNA-seq
data at the gene, isoform and splicing-event level, with more coming out
every day. It would be great if when a new caller comes out, there was
a way to automatically place it in the context of the other callers. This
project aims to do that.

## Why Clojure?
It was time to learn a new language and Clojure is really fun.
